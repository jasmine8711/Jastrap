# Jastrap

*([live demo](https://jasmine8711.github.io/Jastrap))*

## Features

Things that have been implemented:

* Grid system
* Nav bar
* Banner
* Form
* Buttons
* Colors
* Vertical alignment

## Grid system

My grid system is based on *flexbox*. It's a minimal
framework which only defines `column` and `row`.
This makes it really extensible, customizable, and easy to use.

## Usage

My system is different from for example *bootstrap* in the
sense that I do not implement X column layout.
Everything is in a row and elements get added in that row.
That means you can decide how many items you can add in a
row and it will automatically, evenly distribute these elements.

To grow a 'column' you can use the standard `flex-grow` property.
